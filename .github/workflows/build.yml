            ## Download Instructions
            
            ### Windows
            1. Download **MA.Grader.Setup.x.x.x.exe** (recommended - includes install wizard)
            2. Run the installer
            3. ⚠️ **Windows may show a blue "Windows protected your PC" warning** — this is normal for apps not from the Microsoft Store
               - Click **"More info"**
               - Click **"Run anyway"**
               - This only happens once!
            4. Follow the install wizard → launches from Start Menu
            
            ### Mac
            1. Download the **.dmg** file
            2. Open it and drag MA Grader to your Applications folder
            3. ⚠️ **macOS may block the app** — this is normal for apps not from the App Store
               
               **If you see "App is damaged and can't be opened":**
               - Open **Terminal** (search for it in Spotlight)
               - Run: `xattr -cr /Applications/MA\ Grader.app`
               - Try opening the app again
               
               **If you see a security warning:**
               - Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
               - Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the MA Grader message
               
               These steps only need to be done once!
